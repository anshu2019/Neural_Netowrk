# Neuralnet

This code implements a Neural Network from scratch to label hand written text.

Datasets We will be using a subset of an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) dataset. This data includes
images of all 26 handwritten letters; our subset will include only the letters “a,” “e,” “g,” “i,” “l,” “n,” “o,”
“r,” “t,” and “u.”

Model specifications -
